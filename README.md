### Project Description
Welcome to the pinnacle of pointless innovation! This is a completly unnecessary system for caring for your pet rock, Does your rock need to be hydrated? Nope. Does it have feelings? Probably not. Does it need a software dashboard and a webcam to tell you it's contemplative? Absolutly not. And yet, here we are.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever stared at a rock and thought,
"Is it... emotionally hydrated?"

No? Of course you haven‚Äôt.

But what if‚Äîjust what if‚Äîthat silent chunk of Earth was secretly begging for a sprinkle of water, a cozy temperature, and a little emotional validation?

In a world overflowing with smart devices, we boldly asked:
‚ÄúWhy not make a smart system for the dumbest possible pet?‚Äù

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Pet Rock Care Dashboard:
The ultimate (and totally unnecessary) toolkit for the most sedentary companion in your life.

 Scan your rock for vibes.
 Hydrate it with the click of a button.
 Monitor its fake ambient temperature.
 Recommend daily activities like "staring blankly at a wall."

Is it useful? No.
Is it practical? Absolutely not.
But is it gloriously over-engineered for a literal rock?
Yes. Yes it is.
